<h1>All about Moxie</h1>
<p class="tagline">Some fun stuff about an adorable pup</p>
        <h2>It all started...</h2>
        <p>...in 2014 in Georgia. Moxie was found in a box with her sister, Katie. They were resuced by a wonderful resuce organization that brough them both up to Maine. She was at an adoption even when her new Mama held her and knew instantly that they were meant to be a family.
